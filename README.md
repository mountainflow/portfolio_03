# Greg Olson Porfolio
This is my personal portfolio of projects that I've done and a showcase of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 

This is also my first delve into CSS animations using SVG files and also CSS grid and Flexbox.

You will not find any libraries like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jquery, Angular or the like on this page. I am creating this from just the basics in order to get away from all the complexity, and just create a nice experience. I am not against these tools, and have used them extensively, just for this site I want to keep it simple.

This is a work in progress. One month from now, this may be a completely different site and experience than what you see now.
