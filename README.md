# Greg Olson Porfolio
---
### This is my personal portfolio of projects that I've done and a showcase of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

---

This is also my first delve into CSS animations using SVG files and also using CSS grid and Flexbox. I am very interested in CSS animations, and what is possible with just HTML and CSS. I do love Javascript and am very happy working with JS and especially React on the front end with Express/Node server side. You may notice I am using some javascript for my carousel.

You will not find any libraries like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jquery, Angular or the like on this page. I am creating this from scratch using just the basics in order to keep things simple, and just create a nice experience. I am not against using these tools, and have used them extensively, just for this site I want to get back to the basics.


#### Technologies Used

* HTML 5
* CSS 3

This is a work in progress. One month from now, this may be a completely different site and experience than what you see now.
