# Greg Olson Porfolio
##### This is my personal portfolio of projects that I've done and a showcase of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 

This is also my first delve into CSS animations using SVG files and also CSS grid and Flexbox. I am very interested in CSS animations, and what is possible with just HTML and CSS. I do love Javascript and am very happy working with React on the front end, and Express/Node server side, as you may notice I am using javascript for my carousel.

You will not find any libraries like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jquery, Angular or the like on this page. I am creating this from scratch using just the basics in order to get away from all the complexity, and just create a nice experience. I am not against these tools, and have used them extensively, just for this site I want to keep it simple and back to the basics.


### Technologies Used

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript

This is a work in progress. One month from now, this may be a completely different site and experience than what you see now.
